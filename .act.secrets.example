# Act Secrets for git-create-update-tag-action
# These secrets are used when running act locally
#
# Note: If you have secrets configured in ~/.actrc, you can leave these commented
# and act will use the values from ~/.actrc instead
#
# Copy this file to .act.secrets and uncomment/modify values as needed:
# - Remove the # at the beginning of the line
# - Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens
#
# WARNING: Never commit .act.secrets to git! It's already in .gitignore

# GitHub Token (for testing GitHub API calls)
# This is automatically provided by act as GITHUB_TOKEN, but you can override it
# The action uses GITHUB_TOKEN as the default if no token input is provided
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# E2E test secrets (uncomment and set to run e2e with act)
# TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
